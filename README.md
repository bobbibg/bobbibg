# Hi, I’m Bobbi 👋

I’ve spent over 20 years working in tech, across full-stack development, technical product management, solutions architecture, and technology leadership.

I focus on building ethical, scalable products that actually ship. I enjoy working where engineering, product, and people meet, and turning complex ideas into systems that are clear, maintainable, and useful in the real world.

I care about good technical judgment, sustainable architecture, and making trade-offs that respect both users and the teams building the work. I’ve led and supported engineers, collaborated closely with stakeholders, and helped move products from early ideas to reliable production systems.

In mid-2024, I stepped back from full-time work to focus on my health. That time gave me space to reset and reflect on what good, sustainable work really looks like. I’m now ready to re-engage, with clarity and energy, and a renewed focus on building thoughtful systems that last.

## What I’m interested in
- Building and scaling real-world systems
- Ethical and sustainable technology
- Pragmatic architecture and delivery
- Supporting teams and sharing context
- Work that values integrity over hype

## How I like to work
- Clear goals, honest trade-offs
- Calm collaboration over heroics
- Shipping matters, but so does sustainability
- People first, systems second

Thanks for stopping by.
